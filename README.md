# gssiyolo Geometric and Sentence-level Semantic Information Transfer Learning for YOLO Based Saffron Stigma Detection

Our method introduces a novel Geometric and Sentence-Level Semantic Information transfer learning (GSSI-YOLO) strategy, enabling the network to capture rich contextual and structural features. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish fine-grained visual patterns in complex backgrounds, a key challenge in saffron detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark and custom-collected datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also delivers the fastest inference time among current leading object detectors. These results highlight the potential of our framework for practical, real-time agricultural applications requiring both precision and speed.
